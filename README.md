Pierce County Employee Engagement Analysis
Prepared by: Olumide Samuel Damilola
Dataset: 14,725 Survey Responses | 12 Engagement Metrics

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes actual employee engagement data from Pierce County. The objective
was to identify areas of strength, pinpoint departments or roles requiring intervention, and
provide actionable recommendations to improve overall workforce satisfaction.
While role clarity is a major strength (92.6%), there are significant social and recognition gaps, particularly
within the Sheriff’s Department and among front-line Staff.

## Methodology
Data Preparation: Cleaned 14,725 records, handled missing values, and consolidated disparate
question strings (specifically regarding growth opportunities).
Filtering: "Not Applicable" responses were excluded from percentage calculations to ensure a
true representation of employee sentiment.

## Findings and Insights
### Sentiment Extremes
The survey revealed a workforce that understands their duties but feels under-recognized.
Highest Agreement: “I know what is expected of me at work” (92.6%). This suggests that Pierce
County has excellent onboarding and job description clarity.
Highest Disagreement: “I have a best friend at work” (47.6%). While this sounds informal, it is a
key Gallup metric for workplace retention and psychological safety.
Recognition Gap: 34.8% of employees have not received praise in the last seven days, which is a
leading indicator of burnout.

### Departmental and Role Patterns
The data shows a "Tale of Two Counties" - highly engaged administrative offices versus
struggling field/safety operations.
Departmental Success: The Communications Office (91.9%) and Emergency Management (90.1%)
are benchmark departments for high morale.
Departmental Risk: The Sheriff’s Department (51.5% Agreement) is in a critical state. Their job
satisfaction score (36.3%) is less than half that of the top-performing departments.
The Seniority Gap: There is a linear correlation between hierarchy and happiness.
Directors: 86.6% Agreement
Staff: 73.9% Agreement
Insight: Leadership feels more connected to the mission, while Staff feel more isolated from it.

## Proposed Action Plan
Based on the data, the following three-pillar strategy is recommended:
### Pillar 1: Cultural Recovery in Public Safety
Action: Conduct town halls and stay interviews within the Sheriff's Department to identify why
only 39% feel they have growth opportunities.
Goal: Raise satisfaction scores by addressing specific stressors unique to that department.

### Pillar 2: The Recognition Initiative
Action: Train supervisors to provide specific, meaningful praise at least once every 7 days
(directly targeting the low score).
Goal: Reduce the 34.8% disagreement rate in the recognition category.
Pillar 3: Social Infrastructure
Action: Implement Cross-Functional Coffee or peer-mentoring programs for Staff-level
employees.
Goal: Improve the Best Friend at Work metric to foster a sense of belonging and reduce
turnover.

## Conclusion
Pierce County has a strong foundation of role clarity and inclusive values. However, the Accountability Gap and the low satisfaction within the Sheriff’s Department pose risks to long-
term operational stability. By shifting focus from what employees do (Role Clarity) to how they
feel (Recognition and Belonging), the county can significantly improve its overall engagement
profile.
